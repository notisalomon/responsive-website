You can find here my semester project from Fernfachhochschule Schweiz for my Bachelor Studies in Computer Science. The semester project was split in 4 milestones:
1. Wireframe & HTML
2. CSS Styling
3. JavaScript Validation
4. API Integration

Since i already wrote the code and already received the grade (very good) from my lecturer, i can now push my project to my public github. That's why you won't see a lot of commits.
